# LoanPredictor
This project aimed to discuss the potential machine learning algorithms that can predict whether a customer is eligible for a bank loan or not. These predictions are made based on certain parameters such as: age, salary, marital status, educational details, dependent family members, details of previous loans if any, etc. The model for loan prediction was developed on three different Algorithms. The idea behind developing the same model on different algorithms was to compare the three different algorithms based on their accuracy percentage. After comparison Logistic Regression algorithm produced the best results in terms of accuracy. Its accuracy was 81%, followed by Random Forest and Decision Tree, respectively. We expect that with time our model would be able to predict the values more accurately as for now the data available with us for training was limited. The loan prediction model doesnâ€™t always predict correct values, so in future we look forward to making our model completely error free and more efficient.
